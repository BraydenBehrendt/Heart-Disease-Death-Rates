Heart Disease Choropleth Map

This project presents an interactive choropleth map visualizing heart disease death rates across U.S. states. 
The map is designed to highlight regional differences in age-adjusted death rates due to heart disease using color coding. 
It allows users to explore data interactively by hovering over states to see specific rates and provides a legend to distinguish death rate ranges clearly.
